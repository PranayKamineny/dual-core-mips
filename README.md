**Dual Core MIPS CPU**

In this project, a Simplified MIPS CPU was designed and developed, capable of running assembly programs and displaying them on an FPGA board. The CPU consists of two main components: the controller and datapath. It communicates with external memory and a general-purpose input/output (GPIO) memory. The project began with writing the register file, consisting of seven 8-bit registers. Following this, the arithmetic logic unit (ALU) and multiplexers were designed according to the datapath block diagram. The regfile, ALU, and multiplexers were then connected, completing the datapath.

The controller was designed as a finite state machine that outputs control signals to direct the flow of data within the processor. It included states such as FETCH, DECODE, EXECUTE, and WRITEBACK, corresponding to different types of instructions, with the state updating at each clock cycle. Each state set the appropriate output signals to the datapath and determined the next state for the controller. The controller and datapath were integrated in the mips module, which served as the processor.

Next, external memory and GPIO memory were defined as arrays of 512 8-bit words. The GPIO memory was mapped to the switches, buttons, LEDs, and 7-segment display in the lab display module, enabling the display of program outputs on the FPGA board. To test the CPU, numerous testbenches were written to load different programs into the external memory and verify full functionality through output waveforms. After testing, a fully operational MIPS CPU was achieved, capable of running programs such as a Fibonacci calculator and a Gaussian sum calculator, with outputs displayed on the FPGA board based on user inputs from the switches.
